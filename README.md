# EDA-for-image-dataset
This involves data preprocessing for image data set.

## Why image preprocessing??
The acquired data are usually messy and come from different sources. To feed them to the ML model (or neural network), they need to be standardized and cleaned up. More often than not, preprocessing is used to conduct steps that reduce the complexity and increase the accuracy of the applied algorithm. We canâ€™t write a unique algorithm for each of the condition in which an image is taken, thus, when we acquire an image, we tend to convert it into a form that allows a general algorithm to solve it.

Therefore, this repository have few steps for image processing carried out by me for one of my project such as:

1. Image resizing
2. Image enhancement 
3. conversion of image formate
4. Scaling of image
5. cropping image in percentage
6. png to jpg conversion
7. tif to jpg conversion
8. Rename of image_name in folder
9. Log transformation
10. Image sharpening


I hope this would help beginner to get idea about few steps.
Thank you
